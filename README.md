=====

This package is used to rank, select, and prioritise items based on multiple characteristics or criteria. The functions have mainly been used for high-dimensional biology experiments and therefore the 'items' are genes, proteins, or metabolites.

The methods are described in this [publication](https://peerj.com/articles/1444/) ([PubMed entry](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26644980)) using a microarray data set, and additional information is in the package vignette on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/desiR/).
